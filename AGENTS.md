# AGENTS.md — UIHTML Console Error Rerouter

This file instructs AI agents (e.g., Google Gemini Jules) on how to understand,
navigate, and contribute to this project correctly.

## Project Overview

**UIHTML Console Error Rerouter** is an open-source MATLAB tool that intercepts
JavaScript `console.error` calls inside MATLAB `uihtml` components and forwards
them to the MATLAB Command Window. This bridges the gap between front-end
JavaScript debugging and MATLAB's native output, eliminating the need to open a
browser developer console during development.

The tool has two integrated parts:
1. **JavaScript shim (`src/js/consoleShim.js`)** — intercepts `console.error` (and
   optionally other levels) and forwards messages to MATLAB via `sendEventToMATLAB`.
   Users never manually include this file — the MATLAB class handles delivery automatically.
2. **MATLAB class (`ConsoleErrorRerouter`)** — wraps a `uihtml` component, automatically
   copies `consoleShim.js` into the same directory as the user's HTML file and injects
   a `<script>` tag to load it, then listens for `HTMLEventReceived` events tagged as
   console errors and prints them to the Command Window without interfering with other
   event handlers the user may have registered.

### Shim Delivery — Important Platform Constraint

MATLAB's `uihtml` component has a hard limitation: supporting files (JS, CSS, etc.)
must reside in the same folder as the HTML file specified in `HTMLSource`, or a
subfolder of it. CDNs and external URLs are explicitly blocked. There is no ES module
system available. This means the shim cannot be loaded via a user-managed `<script>`
tag pointing to a fixed path — the path would break any time the user's HTML file
lives in a different directory.

The solution is for `ConsoleErrorRerouter` to own shim delivery entirely:
- On construction, it reads `HTMLSource` to determine the HTML file's directory.
- It copies `consoleShim.js` from the package's own `src/js/` directory (resolved via
  `mfilename('fullpath')`) into that directory.
- It rewrites `HTMLSource` to prepend `<script src="consoleShim.js"></script>` to the
  HTML content so the shim loads first.
- On destruction, it removes the copied `consoleShim.js` and restores the original
  `HTMLSource`.

**User-facing HTML files must contain no reference to the shim whatsoever.**

## Coding Conventions

### MATLAB
- **Style**: Follow MathWorks MATLAB style guidelines.
  - `lowerCamelCase` for variables and function names.
  - `UpperCamelCase` for class names and properties.
  - Lines must not exceed **100 characters**.
- **Classes**: Use `classdef` with `properties` blocks. Separate dependent
  properties into their own `properties (Dependent)` block. Document every public
  property and method with a one-line comment above the declaration.
- **Error IDs**: Use namespaced error IDs in all `error()` calls:
  `error('uihtmlRerouter:badArgument', 'Message here.')`.
- **No global state**: Do not use `global` or `persistent` variables in the main
  class. Encapsulate all state as object properties.
- **Backward compatibility**: Target MATLAB R2023a and later. While `uihtml` itself
  was introduced in R2019b, the bidirectional event API this tool depends on —
  specifically `sendEventToMATLAB` (JavaScript) and `HTMLEventReceivedFcn` (MATLAB)
  — was not introduced until R2023a (see Version History on the
  [uihtml docs page](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/uihtml.html)).
  Do not use language features introduced after R2023a without a version guard.

### JavaScript
- **ES5 compatible** — the embedded browser in older MATLAB releases may not
  support ES6+ syntax. Use `var`, not `let`/`const`. Use function declarations,
  not arrow functions.
- Keep `consoleShim.js` self-contained with no external dependencies.
- The shim must call `window.sendEventToMATLAB` using the reserved event name
  `"ConsoleError"` and pass a plain object `{ level, message, stack }`.
- Do not rename or repurpose the `"ConsoleError"` event name — the MATLAB class
  filters on this string.

### HTML examples / fixtures
- Keep example HTML files minimal — their purpose is to demonstrate the tool, not
  showcase web design.
- HTML files must contain **no reference to the shim**. `ConsoleErrorRerouter` injects
  it automatically at runtime. An HTML file with a manually added shim `<script>` tag
  is a bug.

## Key Interfaces (do not change without updating tests)

### `ConsoleErrorRerouter` MATLAB class

| Member | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ConsoleErrorRerouter(uihtmlComp)` | Constructor | Accepts a `matlab.ui.control.HTML` object. Copies `consoleShim.js` next to the user's HTML file, injects a `<script>` tag into `HTMLSource`, and registers the internal `HTMLEventReceived` callback. |
| `Enabled` | Property (`logical`) | Toggles rerouting on/off without destroying the object. Default: `true`. |
| `ErrorLevels` | Property (`string` array) | Console levels to intercept. Default: `["error"]`. Allowed: `"error"`, `"warn"`, `"info"`, `"log"`. |
| `FormatFcn` | Property (`function_handle`) | Custom formatter `f(level, message, stack) → char`. Default: built-in red-text formatter using `fprintf`. |
| `delete()` | Destructor | Removes the copied `consoleShim.js`, restores the original `HTMLSource`, and unregisters only the rerouter's listener — preserving any other `HTMLEventReceived` listeners on the component. |

### JavaScript shim event payload

```json
{
  "level":   "error",
  "message": "Uncaught TypeError: cannot read property...",
  "stack":   "TypeError: ...\n    at foo (example.html:42)"
}
```

## What Agents Should and Should Not Do

### ✅ Agents MAY
- Add new methods or properties to `ConsoleErrorRerouter` that are additive and
  backward-compatible.
- Extend `ErrorLevels` support in both the JS shim and the MATLAB class.
- Add new tests to `tests/tConsoleErrorRerouter.m`.
- Add new example scripts under `examples/`.
- Improve inline documentation (comments, help text).
- Refactor internals for clarity, as long as all public interfaces remain unchanged.
- Fix bugs, provided the fix is covered by a new or updated test.

### ❌ Agents MUST NOT
- Change the `"ConsoleError"` event name string in either the JS or MATLAB code
  without a coordinated update to both sides and all tests.
- Introduce any new MATLAB toolbox dependency (the tool must run on MATLAB base
  with no additional toolboxes).
- Use `evalin`, `evalc`, or `eval` anywhere in MATLAB code.
- Modify `consoleShim.js` to use ES6+ syntax without a compatibility gate.
- Remove or rename any public property or method listed in the Key Interfaces table.
- Add files outside the directory structure defined above without updating this
  AGENTS.md and the README.
- Add any `<script>` tag referencing the shim to any HTML file in `examples/` or
  `tests/`. Shim delivery is handled exclusively by `ConsoleErrorRerouter`. An HTML
  file that manually loads the shim is a bug.

## Testing

All tests live in `tests/tConsoleErrorRerouter.m` and use the `matlab.unittest`
framework.

**Run tests:**
```matlab
results = runtests('tests/tConsoleErrorRerouter.m');
disp(results)
```

**Every pull request must:**
1. Pass all existing tests with zero failures and zero errors.
2. Include new tests for any new behavior introduced.
3. Not decrease code coverage on the `ConsoleErrorRerouter` class.

When adding tests, follow this pattern:

```matlab
methods (Test)
    function myNewTest(testCase)
        % Arrange
        comp = createMockUihtmlComponent();
        rerouter = ConsoleErrorRerouter(comp);

        % Act
        fireConsoleErrorEvent(comp, 'error', 'Test message');

        % Assert
        testCase.verifyEqual(rerouter.LastMessage, 'Test message');
    end
end
```
